# BIDMach_Viz

### Add interactivity to existing BIDMach script

This part assumes that you already have a script for BIDMach. We will use kmeans.ssc 
in this repository as example.

Steps:
#### Use an alternative version BIDMach that exposes a field in Learner.Options for datasink
Please use the BIDMach from this repository 

#### Clone this repository

#### Modify the script to add WebDataSink

### Interactive Machine Learning toolkit based on BIDMach

#### Install and build

This toolkit uses [play] web framework and it requires Java 8. We use [maven] for package management. You can modify [pom.xml] to configure the build process. 

We support both CUDA 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0. You will need to change the project version in pom.xml to 1.1.0-cuda7.0  1.1.0-cuda7.5 or 1.1.1-cuda8.0 base on your preference. 

To compile the project, use:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMach_Viz.git
mvn compile
</pre>

To generate the package and pull all the jars into the lib folder, use:
<pre>
mvn package
</pre>

After you get all the jars, the web server can be started using:
<pre>
./sbt -J-Xmx32g run
</pre>

And then select the program you would like to run.
